# My personal .dotfiles

Highly inspired by Christoph Rumpel's Dotfiles.

Be careful when using these dotfiles because they change a lot of MacOS settings and install all the apps I need. 

## Backup Checklist
- Did you commit and push any changes/branches to your git repositories?
- Did you copy your .env files to a safe place if they are not casual?
- Did you copy your IDE settings? (e.g. PhpStorm)
- Did you backup local databases you need?
- Did you remember to save all important documents from non-cloud directories?
- Did you save all of your work from apps which aren't synced through cloud?
- Did you update mackup to the latest version and ran mackup backup?
